# 📊 Instagram Follower Analyzer GUI

A Python-based GUI app to analyze your Instagram followers and followings.

It tells you:
- ❌ **Traitors** — People you follow but they don’t follow you back
- 🫶 **Fans** — People who follow you but you don’t follow back
- 🤝 **Mutuals** — Accounts where both follow each other

Each list is saved as a `.txt` file:
- `traitors.txt`
- `fans.txt`
- `mutuals.txt`

## 🧾 How to Get Your Instagram Session ID

> Instagram uses a sessionid cookie to keep you logged in. We'll use this safely (no password needed) to analyze your followers.

### 🔍 Steps to Get sessionid:

#### For Chrome:

1. Open [instagram.com](https://instagram.com) and log in to your account.
2. Right-click anywhere on the page and select **Inspect** or press `Ctrl+Shift+I`.
3. Go to the **Application** tab.
4. In the left menu, under **Storage**, click on **Cookies** → `https://www.instagram.com`
5. Find the cookie named `sessionid` and copy its value.

#### For Firefox:

1. Log in to Instagram and right-click → **Inspect Element**
2. Go to **Storage > Cookies**
3. Copy the value of the `sessionid`

> 🛑 **Never share this session ID with anyone — it can be used to access your Instagram account.**
